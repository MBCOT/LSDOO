Live streams of data over OMNIA


- Use OMNIA to build some kind of streaming protocol , as
over eltoo channels we can do an unlimited number of transactions we can use it to embed data on
tokens as state vars(64k) .

- And if the we can't send the same token to more than one user, this could be done if we build an
smart contract, this would generate a unique address so the tokens would be sent to that address and
every people who registered the same smart contract would have access to the same tokens, so
basically a way to establish a stream protocol and live feed data.

- If not of this is possible, find a way to do it
